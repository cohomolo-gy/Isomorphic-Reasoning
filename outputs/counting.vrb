We can certainly show it explicitly:

\begin{block}{}

\begin{center}
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
		to :: Either () () -> Bool
		to (Right ()) = True
		to (Left ())  = False

		from :: Bool -> Either () ()
		from True = Right ()
		from False = Left ()
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{center}
\end{block}
